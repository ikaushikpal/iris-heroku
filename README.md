# Iris web app deployed on Heroku
___

<!-- The deployed web app is live at https://dp-penguins.herokuapp.com/ -->

This web app predicts the species of iris flower as a function of their input parameters (SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength and PetalWidth).

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* joblib
  
And to create model some addition libraries needed:
* matplotlib
* seaborn

This is my first End-to-End ML project, feel free to sent me pull request if i need any corrections.

**Thank You**.
